# Hello! I'm Kamlesh Nehra ðŸ‘‹
I have been writing code in JavaScript and TypeScript for over 6 years, and I am still learning and exploring these languages. My journey in coding has been enriched by continuous learning and sharing knowledge with others in my own words.

## Programming Languages and Frameworks

Here are some of the languages and frameworks I have experience with:

- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**
- **React.js**
- **Next.js**
- **Vue.js**
- **Angular.js**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Python**
- **Node.js**

## About Me

I believe in the power of community and the importance of sharing knowledge. I try to learn from everyone and then pass on that knowledge to others in a way that makes sense to me.

Feel free to connect with me for collaborations, discussions, or any help related to the above technologies!
